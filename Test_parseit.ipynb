       "'BusTUC - A natura l  l anguage bus  route  o rac le  \\nTore Amble \\nDept. of computer and information science \\nUniversity of Trondheim \\nNorway, N-7491 \\namble@idi, ntnu. no \\nAbstract \\nThe paper describes a natural anguage based expert \\nsystem route advisor for the public bus transport \\nin Trondheim, Norway. The system is available on \\nthe Internet,and has been intstalled at the bus com- \\npany\\'s web server since the beginning of 1999. The \\nsystem is bilingual, relying on an internal anguage \\nindependent logic representation. \\n1 Introduct ion \\nA natural anguage interface to a computer database \\nprovides users with the capability of obtaining in- \\nformation stored in the database by querying the \\nsystem in a natural language (NL). With a natural \\nlanguage as a means of communication with a com- \\nputer system, the users can make a question or a \\nstatement in the way they normally think about the \\ninformation being discussed, freeing them from hav- \\ning to know how the computer stores or processes \\nthe information. \\nThe present implementation represents a a major \\neffort in bringing natural anguage into practical use. \\nA system is developed that can answer queries about \\nbus routes, stated as natural language texts, and \\nmade public through the Internet World Wide Web \\n( http : //www. idi. ntnu. no/bustuc/). \\nTrondheim is a small city with a university and \\n140000 inhabitants. Its central bus systems has 42 \\nbus lines, serving 590 stations, with 1900 depar- \\ntures per day (in average). That gives approximately \\n60000 scheduled bus station passings per day, which \\nis somehow represented in the route data base. \\nThe starting point is to automate the function of \\na route information agent. The following example \\nof a system response is using an actual request over \\ntelephone to the local route information company: \\nHi, I live in Nidarvoll and tonight i \\nmust reach a train to Oslo at 6 oclock. \\nand a typical answer would follow quickly: \\nBus number 54 passes by Nidarvoll skole \\nat 1710 and arrives at Trondheim Railway \\nStation at 1725. \\nIn between the question and the answer is a pro- \\ncess of lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic \\nanalysis, pragmatic reasoning and database query \\nprocessing. \\nOne could argue that the information content \\ncould be solved by an interrogation, whereby the \\ncustomer is asked to produce 4 items: s ta t ion  \\nof departure, station of arrival, earliest \\ndeparture timeand/or latest arrival time. It \\nis a myth that natural language is a better way of \\ncommunication because it is \"natural language\". \\nThe challenge is to prove by demonstration that \\nan NL system can be made that will be preferred \\nto the interrogative mode. To do that, the system \\nhas to be correct, user friendly and almost complete \\nwithin the actual domain. \\n2 Previous Efforts, CHAT-80, \\nPRAT-89 and HSQL \\nThe system, called BusTUC is built upon the clas- \\nsical system CHAT-80 (Warren and Pereira, 1982). \\nCHAT-80 was a state of the art natural anguage sys- \\ntem that was impressive on its own merits, but also \\nestablished Prolog as a viable and competitive lan- \\nguage for Artificial Intelligence in general. The sys- \\ntem was a brilliant masterpiece of software, efficient \\nand sophisticated. The natural anguage system was \\nconnected to a small query system for international \\ngeography. The following query could be analysed \\nand answered in a split second: \\nWhich country bordering the Mediterranean \\nborders a country that is bordered by a \\ncountry whose population exceeds the \\npopulation of India? \\n(The answer \\'Turkey\\' has become incorrect as \\ntime has passed. The irony is that Geography was \\nchosen as a domain without time.) \\nThe abi!ity to answer ridiculously long queries is \\nof course not the main goal. The main lesson is that \\ncomplex sentences are analysed with a proper under- \\nstanding without sacrificing efficiency. Any superfi- \\ncial pattern matching technique would prove futile \\nsooner or later. \\n2.1 Making a Norwegian CHAT-80, \\nPRAT-89 \\nAt the University of Trondheim (NTNU), two stu- \\ndents made a Norwegian version of CHAT-80,called \\nPRAT-89 (Teigen and Vetland, 1988),(Teigen and \\nVetland, 1989). (Also, a similar Swedish project \\nSNACK-85 was reported). \\nThe dictionary was changed from English to Nor- \\nwegian together with new rules for morphological \\nanalysis. The change of grammar from English to \\nNorwegian proved to be amazingly easy. It showed \\nthat the langauges were more similar than one would \\nbelieve, given that the languages are incomprehen- \\nsible to each other\\'s communities. \\nAfter changing the dictionary and graramar, the \\nfollowing Norwegian query about the same domain \\ncould be answered correctly in a few seconds. \\nHvilke afrikanske land som hat en \\nbefolkning stoerre enn 3 millioner \\nog mindre enn 50 millioner og er nord \\nfor Botswana og oest for Libya hat en \\nhovedstad som hat en befolkning stoerre \\nenn 100 tusen. \\n( A translation is beside the point o.f being a long \\nquery in Norwegian.) \\n2.2 HSQL - Help System for SQL \\nA Nordic project HSQL (Help System for SQL) was \\naccomplished in 1988-89 to make a joint Nordic ef- \\nfort interfaces to databases. \\nThe HSQL project was led by the Swedish State \\nBureau (Statskontoret), with participants from Swe- \\nden, Denmark, Finland and Norway (Amble et al, \\n1990). The aim of HSQL was to build a natural \\nlanguage interface to SQL databases for the Scandi- \\nnavian languages Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. \\nThese languages are very similar, and the Norwe- \\ngian version of CHAT-80 was easily extended to the \\nother Scandinavian languages. Instead of Geogra- \\nphy, a more typical application area was chosen to \\nbe a query system for hospital administration. We \\ndecided to target an SQL database of a hospital ad- \\nministration which had been developed already. \\nThe next step was then to change the domain \\nof discourse from Geography to hospital adminis- \\ntration, using the same knowledge representation \\ntechniques used in CHAT-80. A semantic model of \\nthis domain was made, and then implemented in the \\nCHAT-80 framework. \\nThe modelling technique that proved adequate \\nwas to use an extended Entity Relationship (ER) \\nmodel with a class (type) hierarchy, attributes be- \\nlonging to each class, single inheritance ofattributes \\nand relationships. \\nCoupling the system to an SQL database. \\nAfter the remodelling, the system could answer \\nqueries in \"Scandinavian\" to an internal hospital \\ndatabase as well as CHAT-80 could answer Geog- \\nraphy questions. HSQL produced a Prolog-like code \\nFOL (First Order Logic) for execution. A mapping \\nfrom FOL to the data base Schema was defined, and \\na translator from FOL to SQL was implemented. \\nThe example \\nHvilke menn ligger i en kvinnes seng? \\n(Which men lie in a woman\\'s bed? ) \\nwould be translated ryly into the SQL query: \\nSELECT DISTINCT \\nT3.name,Tl.sex,T2.reg_no,T3.sex, \\nT4.reg_no,T4.bed_no,T5.hosp_no,T5.ward_no \\nFROM PATIENT TI,OCCUPANCY T2,PATIENT T3, \\nOCCUPANCY T4,WARD T5 \\nWHERE \\n(Tl.sex=\\'f\\') AND \\n(T2.reg_no=Tl.reg_no) AND \\n(T3.sex=\\'m\\') AND \\n(T4.reg_no=T3.reg_no) AND \\n(T4.bed_no=T2.bed_no) AND \\n(T5.hosp_no=T4.hosp_no) AND \\n(T5.ward_no=T4.ward_no) \\n2.3 The The Understanding Computer \\nThe HSQL was a valuable xperience in the effort \\nto make transportable natural anguage interfaces. \\nHowever, the underlying system CHAT-80 restricted \\nthe further development. \\nAfter the HSQL Project was finished, an inter- \\nnal reseach project TUC (the Understanding Com- \\nputer) was initiated at NTNU to carry on the results \\nfrom HSQL. The project goals differed from those of \\nHSQL in a number of ways, and would not be con- \\ncerned with multimedia interfaces . On the other \\nhand, portability and versatility were made central \\nissues concerning the generality of the language and \\nits applications. The research goals could be sum- \\nmarised as to \\n? Give computers an operational understanding \\nof natural language. \\n? Build intelligent systems with natural language \\ncapabilities. \\n? Study common sense reasoning in natural an- \\nguage. \\nA test criterion for the understanding capacity is \\nthat after a set of definitions in a Naturally Read- \\nable Logic, NRL, the system\\'s answer to queries in \\nNRL should conform to the answers of an idealised \\nrational agent. \\nEvery man that lives loves Mary. \\nJohn is a man. John lives. \\nWho loves Mary? \\n==> John \\nNRL is defined in a closed context. Thus in- \\nterfaces to other systems are in principle defined \\nthrough simulating the environment as a dialogue \\npartner. \\nTUC is a prototypical natural language proces- \\nsor for English written in Prolog. It is designed to \\nbe a general purpose easily adaptable natural lan- \\nguage processor. It consists of a general grammar \\nfor a subset of English, a semantic knowledge base, \\nand modules for interfaces to other interfaces like \\nUNIX, SQL-databases and general textual informa- \\ntion sources. \\n2.4 The  TABOR Project \\nIt so happened that a Universtity Project was start- \\neded in 1996, called TABOR ( \" Speech based user \\ninterfaces and reasoning systems \"), with the aim of \\nbuilding an automatic public transport route oracle, \\navailable over the public telephone. At the onset of \\nthe project, the World Wide Web was fresh, and not \\nas widespread as today, and the telephone was still \\nregarded as the main source of information for the \\npublic. \\nSince then, the Internet became the dominant \\nmedium, and it is as likeley to find a computer with \\nInternet connection, as to find a local busroute table. \\n( The consequtive wide spreading of cellular phones \\nchanged the picture in favour of the telephone, but \\nthat is another story). \\nIt was decided that a text based information sys- \\ntem should be built, regardless of the status of the \\nspeech rocgnition and speech synthesis effort, which \\nproved to lag behind after a while. \\nThe BusTUC system \\nThe resulting system BusTUC grew out as a natural \\napplication of TUC, and an English prototype could \\nbe built within a few months (Bratseth, 1997). \\nSince the summer 1996, the prototype was put \\nonto the Internet, and been developed and tested \\nmore or less continually until today. The most im- \\nportant extension was that the system was made \\nbilingual (Norwegian and English) during the fall \\n1996. \\nIn spring 1999, the BusTUC was finally adopted \\nby the local bus company in Trondheim ( A/S \\nTrondheim Trafikkselskap), which set up a server ( \\na 300 MHz PC with Linux). \\nUntil today, over 150.000 questions have been an- \\nswered, and BusTUC seems to stabilize and grow \\nincreasingly popular. \\n3 \\n3 Anatomy o f  the  bus  route  orac le  \\nThe main components of the bus route information \\nsystems are: \\n? A parser system, consisting of a dictionary, a \\nlexical processor, a grammar and a parser. \\n? A knowledge base (KB), divided into a semantic \\nKB and an application KB \\n? A query processor, contalng a routing logic sys- \\ntem, and a route data base. \\nThe system is bilingual and contains a double set \\nof dictionary, morphology and grammar. Actually, it \\ndetects which language is most probable by count- \\ning the number of unknown words related to each \\nlanguage, and acts accordingly. The grammars are \\nsurprisingly similar, but no effort is made to coa- \\nlesce them. The Norwegian grammar is slightly big- \\nger than the English grammar, mostly because it is \\nmore elaborated but also because Norwegian allows \\na freer word order. \\n3.1 Features  of  BusTUC \\nFor the Norwegian systems, the figures give an in- \\ndication of the size of the domain: 420 nouns, 150 \\nverbs, 165 adjectives, 60 prepositions, etc. \\nThere are 1300 grammar ules ( 810 for English) \\nalthough alf of the rules are very low level. \\nThe semantic net described below contains about \\n4000 entries. \\nA big name table of 3050 names in addition to \\nthe official station names, is required to capture the \\nvariety of naming. A simple spell correction is a part \\nof the system ( essentially 1 character errors). \\nThe pragmatic reasoning is needed to translate the \\noutput from the parser to a route database query \\nlanguage . This is done by a production system \\ncalled Pragma, which acts like an advanced rewrit- \\ning system with 580 rules. \\nIn addition, there is another ule base for actually \\ngenerating the natural anguage answers (120 rules). \\nThe system is mainly written in Prolog (Sicstus \\nProlog 3.7), with some Perl programs for the com- \\nmunication and CGI-scripts. \\nAt the moment, there are about 35000 lines of \\nprogrammed Prolog code (in addition to route tables \\nwhich are also in Prolog). \\nAverage response time is usually less than 2 sec- \\nonds, but there are queries that demand up to 10 \\nseconds. \\nThe error rate for single, correct, complete and \\nrelevant questions is about 2 percent. \\n3.2 The Parser System \\nThe Grammar System \\nThe grammar is based on a simple grammar for \\nstatements, while questions and commands are de- \\nrived by the use of movements. The grammar \\nformalism which is called Consensical Grammar, \\n(CONtext SENSitive CompositionAL Grammar) is \\nan easy to use variant of Extraposition Grammar \\n(Pereira and Warren, 1980), which is a generalisa- \\ntion of Definite Clause Grammars. Compositional \\ngrammar means that the semantics of a a phrase is \\ncomposed of the semantics of the subphrases; the ba- \\nsic constituents being a form of verb complements. \\nAs for Extraposition grammars, a grammar is trans- \\nlated to Definite Clause Grammars, and executed as \\nsuch. \\nA characteristic syntactic expression in Consen- \\nsical Grammar  may define an incomplete construct \\nin terms of a \"difference \" between complete con- \\nstructs. When possible, the parser will use the sub- \\ntracted part in stead of reading from the input, after \\na gap if necessary. The effect is the same as for Ex- \\ntraposition grammars, but the this format is more \\nintuitive. \\nExamples of grammar rules. \\nwhich is analysed as \\nfor which X is it true that \\nthe (X) person has a dog that barked? \\nwhere the last line is analysed as a statement. \\nMovement is easily handled in Consensical Gram- \\nmar without making special phrase rules for each \\nkind of movement. The following example shows \\nhow TUC manages a variety of analyses using move- \\nments: \\nMax said Bill thought \\nJoe believed Fido Barked. \\nWho said Bill thought \\nJoe believed Fido barked? ==> Max \\nWho did Max say thought \\nJoe believed Fido barked? ==> Bill \\nstatement(P) ---> \\nnoun_phrase(X,VP,P), \\nverb_phrase(X,VP). \\nstatement(Q) ---> \\nverb_complementsO(VC), \\nZZ initial optional verb complements \\nstatement(Q) -... \\nverb_complementsO(VC). \\nZZ may be inserted after a gap \\nwhoseq(P) ---> Z whose dog barked? \\n\\\\[whose\\\\], \\nhOlm(N), \\nwhoq(P) - ~ without gap \\n(\\\\[who\\\\],\\\\[has\\\\],\\\\[a\\\\],noun(N),\\\\[that\\\\]). \\nwhoq(P) ---> \\n\\\\[who\\\\], \\nwhichq(P) - (\\\\[which\\\\],\\\\[person\\\\]). \\nwhichq(which(X)::P) ---> \\n\\\\[which\\\\], \\nstatement(P) - the(X). \\nExample: \\nWhose dog barked? \\nis analysed as if the sentence had been \\nWho has a dog that  barked? \\nwhich is analysed as \\nWhich person has a dog that  barked? \\nWho did Max say Bill thought \\nbelieved Fido barked? ==> Joe \\nThe parser \\nThe experiences with Consensical grammars are a \\nbit mixed however. The main problem is the parsing \\nmethod itself, which is top down with backtracking. \\nMany principles that would prove elegant for small \\ndomains turned out to be too costly for larger do- \\nmains, due to the wide variety of modes of expres- \\nsions, incredible ambiguities and the sheer size of the \\ncovered language. \\nThe disambiguation is a major problem for small \\ngrammars and large languages, and was solved by \\nthe following guidelines: \\n? a semantic type checking was integrated into the \\nparser, and would help to discard sematica/ly \\nwrong parses from the start. \\n? a heuristics was followed that proved almost ir- \\nreproachable: The longest possible phrase of a \\ncategory that is semantically correct is in most \\ncases the preferred interpretation. \\n? due to the perplexity of the language, some \\ncommitted choices (cuts) had to be inserted into \\nthe grammar at strategic places. As one could \\nfear however, this implied that wrong choices \\nbeing made at some point in the parsing could \\nnot be recovered by backtracking. \\nThese problems also made it imperative to intro- \\nduce a timeout on the parsing process of embarass- \\ning 10 seconds. Although most sentences, would be \\nparsed within a second, some legal sentences ofmod- \\nerate size actually need this time. \\n4 \\n3.3 The semantic knowledge base \\nAdaptability means that the system does not need \\nto be reprogrammed foreach new application. \\nThe design principle of TUC is that most of the \\nchanges are made in a tabular semantic knowledge \\nbase, while there is one general grammar and dictio- \\nnary. In general, the logic is generated automatically \\nfrom the semantic knowledge base. \\nThe nouns play a key role in the understanding \\npart as they constitute the class or type hierarchy. \\nNouns are defined in an a-kind-of hierarchy. The \\nhierarchy is tree-structured with single inheritance. \\nThe top level also constitute the top level ontology \\nof TUC\\'s world. \\nIn fact, a type check of the compliances of verbs, \\nnouns adjectives and prepositions i  not only neces- \\nsary for the semantic processing but is essential for \\nthe syntax analysis for the disambiguation aswell. \\nIn TUC, the legal combinations are carefully assem- \\nbled in the semantic network, which then serves a \\ndual purpose. \\nThese semantic definitions are necessary to allow \\nfor instance the following sentences \\nThe dog saw a man with a telescope. \\nThe man saw a dog with a telescope. \\nto be treated differently because with telescope \\nmay modify the noun man but not the noun dog, \\nwhile with telescope modifies the verb see, re- \\nstricted to person. \\n3.4 The Query Processor \\nEvent Calculus \\nThe semantics of the phrases are built up by a kind \\nof verb complements, where the event play a central \\nrole. \\nThe text is translated from Natural anguage into \\na form called TQL (Temporal Query Language/ \\nTUC Query Language) which is a first order event \\ncalculus expression, a self contained expression con- \\ntaining the literal meaning of an utterance. \\nA formalism TQL that was defined, inspired by \\nthe Event Calculus by Kowalski and Sergot (Kowal- \\nski and Sergot, 1986). \\nThe TQL expressions consist of predicates, func- \\ntions, constants and variables. The textual words \\nof nouns and verbs are translated to generic predi- \\ncates using the selected interpretation. The follow- \\ning question \\nDo you know whether the bus goes \\nto Nidar on Saturday ?\\nwould give the TQL expression below. Typically, \\nthe Norwegian equivalent \\nVet du om bussen gaar \\ntil Nidar paa soendag ? \\n5 \\ngives exactly the same code. \\ntest:: % \\nisa(real,program,tuc), % \\nisa(real,bus,A), % \\nisa(real,saturday,B), % \\nisa(real,place,nidar), % \\nevent(real,D), % \\nType of question \\ntuc is a program \\nA is a real bus \\nB isa saturday \\nNidar is a place \\nD is an event \\nknow(whether,tuc,C,D), Y. C was known at D \\nevent (C , E) , Y. E is an event in C \\naction(go,E), Y. the action of E is Go \\nactor(A,E), Y. the actor of E is A \\nsrel(to,place,nidar,E),Y. E is to nidar \\nsrel(on,time,B,E), y, E is on the saturday B \\nThe event parameter plays an important role in \\nthe semantics. It is used for various purposes. The \\nmost salient role is to identify a subset of time and \\nspace in which an action or event occured. Both the \\nactual time and space coordinates are connected to \\nthe actions through the event parameter. \\nPragmatic reasoning \\nThe TQL is translated to a route database query \\nlanguage (BusLOG) which is actually a Prolog pro- \\ngram. This is done by a production system called \\nPragma, which acts like an advanced rewriting sys- \\ntem with 580 rules. \\nIn addition, there is another rule base for actually \\ngenerating the natural language answers (120 rules). \\n4 Conc lus ions  \\nThe TUC approach as as its goal to automate the \\ncreation of new natural language interfaces for a well \\ndefined subset of the language and with a minimum \\nof explicit programming. \\nThe implemented system has proved its worth, \\nand is interesting if for no other reason. There is \\nalso an increasing interest from other bus compa- \\nnies and route information companies alike to get a \\nsimilar system for their customers. \\nFurther work remains to make the parser really \\nefficient, and much work remains to make the lan- \\nguage coverage complete within reasonable imits. \\nIt is an open question whether the system of this \\nkind will be a preferred way of offering information \\nto the public. \\nIf it is, it is a fair amount of work to make it a \\nportable system that can be implemented lsewhere, \\nalso connecting various travelling agencies. \\nIf not, it will remain a curiosity. But anyway, a\\nsystem like this will be a contribution to the devel- \\nopment of intelligent systems. \\nRe ferences  \\nTore Amble, Erik Knudsen, Aarno Lehtola, Jan \\nLjungberg, and Ole Ravnholt. 1990.
